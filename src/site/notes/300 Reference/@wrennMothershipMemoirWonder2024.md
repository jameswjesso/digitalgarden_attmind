>[!Abstract]
> A dazzling, evidence-based account of one man’s quest to heal from complex PTSD by turning to endangered coral reefs and psychedelic plants after traditional therapies failed—and his awakening to the need for us to heal the planet as well.
> 
> Professor Greg Wrenn likes to tell his nature-writing students, “The ecological is personal, and the personal is ecological.” What he’s never told them is how he’s lived out those correspondences to heal from childhood abuse at the hands of his mother.
> 
> Weaving together memoir and cutting-edge science, Mothership is not just a queer coming-of-age story.It’s a deeply researched account of how coral reefs and a psychedelic tea called ayahuasca helped Greg heal from complex PTSD—a disorder of trust, which makes the very act of bonding with someone else panic-inducing. From the tide pools in Florida where he grew up, to Indonesia’s Raja Ampat archipelago and the Amazon rainforest, this is his search for wholeness when talk therapy and pharmaceuticals did little to help. Along the way, as his ecological conscience wakes up, he takes readers underwater to the last pristine reefs on earth, and into the psyche.
> 
> Written with prophetic urgency, Mothership ultimately asks if doses of nature will be enough to save us before it’s too late.

## Notes

##### What is it like to appreciate the beauty of living something we are a part of ending?

The questions below felt like an invitation 

> What is it like to appreciate an ecosystem that will collapse in our lifetimes? To be moved by beauty that we’re pushing toward extinction?—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 18)

  
....  

> Along with Star Trek, E.T. is still one of my sustaining mythologies. It’s a fable about mutual rescuing and grace—about trying to understand someone different from you and realizing you’re basically the same.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 28)

  
....  

> She’s practicing what I like to call the three Ss: slowing down, softening, savoring. Rather than unwittingly traumatizing her children, which she never did anyway, she tries to meet them right where they are.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 48)

##### Facts about the collapse of Coral Reefs in the Florida Keys


> But since 1975, the Florida Keys have lost over 90 percent of its live coral. At Dry Rocks today, the hard coral is virtually all dead, even the ancient brain coral near the statue. To put the staggering losses another way: in my lifetime, coral coverage in the Keys has dropped to 2 percent, the keystone species of elkhorn and staghorn coral having declined by about 97 percent. These two coral species, once the very building blocks of reefs in the Atlantic, are now critically endangered. On top of that, seawater increasingly acidic from absorbing our CO2 is slowly eating away at the little remaining coral there, forty years earlier than expected. Imagine Yosemite’s redwoods turning white and dying, the saplings too, with fewer and fewer seeds left to germinate, and you begin to get the idea. Think E.T. sick and white in the ditch.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 53)

> But their anxiety, at times immobilizing, isn’t purely ecological. It’s digital: my students are overstimulated and mentally imbalanced from mainlining social media. I shouldn’t be offended when they ask me to create exam study guides for them—many of their brains, rewired by the likes of TikTok, can’t keep up with the course material, or much of anything for that matter, heightening their anxiety. Since high school, TikTok has been barraging them with ten-second videos individually tailored to maximize the dopamine hit and the company’s profits. They’re hooked, as recent neuroscience research suggests, the parts of the brain involved in addiction lighting up as they watch content based on hyper-personalized algorithms.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 58)

  
....  
Internet addiction Q

> put me on Zoloft, which didn’t do a thing but space me out. After I quit cold turkey, I was beset by brain shivers and mood swings. I howled in a rainy city park for the Virgin Mary and spent the night in the hospital. Soon after, David’s family put me in touch with a therapist named Holly who specialized in mothers and sons. Other than hanging out in chat rooms and watching porn—habits that got so addictive I ripped out the ethernet card from my laptop—I often didn’t know what else to do with my free time. Cyberspace reliably drowned out what my parents had recently unloaded on me on the phone and at Thanksgiving. “Keep paying attention to your body,” Holly said when I told her about my emerging compulsions, encouraging me to meditate and join clubs. Wasn’t there something else she could do?—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 77)

  
....  
Ecoogical Grief Q

> When I floated above the reefs and found myself apologizing to them, the figure of 400 ppm of CO2 drifting through my mind, I was crying tears of what’s been called anticipatory grief. Sometimes I half-expected the reefs to disintegrate right in front of me like damp cotton candy. I know coral bleaching and ocean acidification don’t work like that, but still, that’s where my mind went.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 88)

  
....  
What if...

> “One way to open your eyes to unnoticed beauty is to ask yourself, ‘What if I had never seen this before? What if I knew I would never see it again?’” To wake up from my residual smartphone trance and grow wonder, I asked variations on the same basic question in my mask and fins that summer.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 90)

  
....  

> Our online followers are seduced by photographic lies. Partly because of this, a sense of falseness and unlovability has permeated our culture. It’s one reason my students kill themselves, one reason there’s collective nihilism. You’re not imagining it. As I learned from the documentary The Social Dilemma, the suicide rate for girls aged fifteen to nineteen has risen 70 percent since social media apps first appeared on smartphones in 2009, 151 percent for girls ten to fourteen. Remember, too, that my now-deleted Grindr and Katya’s Instagram weren’t free platforms; we’d been working unpaid for them, raising ad revenue with our content. Meanwhile, we grew shallower and more addicted.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 130)

  
....  
Obligation

> I understood the stroke was traumatic for her, that her unresolved trauma, which wasn’t her fault, helped cause it—and that coming back to her house made her shocking disability even more real. I had compassion for her. I did. But it all felt too familiar: helplessness alongside obsessive, rude attempts at absolute control. Forgive me if I sound self-righteous, but remember I was taking care of her despite our history. On her behalf, I had sold the house I grew up in. Before listing it, I came to Jacksonville in my free time to deep clean bedrooms and bathrooms where abuse went down, to sort through decades of fingerpainted artwork, legal papers, and trash. I was a resentful mess, a wad of annihilation panic, but I had no other choice but to help her. As her son, it was my moral duty. My obligations were not lost to me.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 148)

  
....  
Changa?

> “I’ll try it,” I said, noticing the sunlight on his stubble, “but you’ve got to hold my hand.” He lit a pipe filled with bits of shredded plant matter. Oh, did I inhale. My body dispersed like dandelion fluff.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 168)

  
....  

> This is why C-PTSD, a disorder of trust, is hard to treat. When sessions get too intense, the client finds—or is confronted with—a reason to distrust the therapist. For a client like me with C-PTSD, no therapist ultimately seems trustworthy enough because, as James put it, imperfection signals danger, a reminder of the inescapable, traumatizing relationship from childhood. “Clients aren’t looking for a new idea,” it’s been said, “they’re looking for a new experience.”—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 187)

##### The physiologial benefits of being in a biodiverse forest


> The more biodiverse a forest is, the wider the array of phytoncides and bacteria, and as research is beginning to indicate, the greater the psychological boost. In Amazonian wetland forests like the one in Tahuayo, there are 3,688 recorded tree species. In the entire Amazon, there are an estimated sixteen thousand species; in Shenandoah National Park, there are only 331; in the woods of my neighborhood in Florida, I’d guess a couple dozen. It stands to reason that, given Tahuayo’s tree density and diversity, this might be one of the best places on earth to forest bathe.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 193)

  
....  

> (I should add that breathing clean air rich with microbes, as we did to varying degrees for thousands of years, should be a birthright. Biodiversity must be protected. Access to wilderness can’t only be for the privileged, affluent, adventurous, able-bodied, and lucky.)—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 193)

  
....  
aya attachment

> “Physiologically, we see activation of the same emotional brain centers with ayahuasca administration as we do in attachment relationships”: this electrifying sentence in a pioneering paper by Jessica Nielson and Julie Megler was highlighted, starred, and circled in my research binder. In other words, ==ayahuasca stimulates the same brain regions that being deeply bonded to someone does, such as a therapist, parent, or partner. The C-PTSD medicine Davi poured activated my brain’s left amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, and over minutes that were years in an alternate timeline, I had the parents I needed.== They asked me to pause in the ever-changing multiverse. Listen. Feel the sensations and learn. Let my character be reconstituted like a caterpillar in a cocoon.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 211)

##### Solastalgia

This is an interesting concept I want to explore more.

> Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht calls solastalgia. This is homesickness you feel at home. The pain (-algia) that comes after the solace (solas-) of the natural world has been diminished. In its most intense forms, it’s traumatic.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 233)

  
....  

> What we’re facing amounts to global C-PTSD. Remember Herman’s definition of the disorder: “prolonged, repeated” interpersonal trauma we can’t flee from. In this case, it’s interpersonal because it’s Mother Earth who is “turning” on us with floods, droughts, wildfires, heat waves, hurricanes, and new pandemics turbocharged by warmer temperatures. Interpersonal, too, because we’re turning on each other.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 233)

  
....  

##### Life Lessons from Row Row Row Your Boat

This is a beautiful.

> *Row, row, row your boat* 
> *Gently down the stream* 
> *Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily* 
> *Life is but a dream* 
> 
> All I ever needed to know was in her song: Stay soft-hearted (“Gently”), cultivate joy (“Merrily”), and work hard (“Row”). In this, our sacred, maddening dream, you can relax. Stop paddling. The water will carry you to the sea. The mothership will bring you home.—(Wrenn, 2024, p. 239)
